That's right, I'm going to be speaking about Technical Debt at Scotch on the Rocks 2014. To say I'm a little nervous is an understatment; I've never spoken at a conference before. Having attended SOTR twice already I'm aware of the format and understand the need to keep the crowd entertained.

So what am I going to be talking about?

Well that's what I now need to figure out. Technical debt is not a physical entity that can be measured as such so how do we know if we're doing the right thing? How can it be measured? Where is it? How does it manifest itself in our daily lives? I've recently taken on a house renovation project and there's definately some technical debt in there! But what about our software? Is it just in the code or is it in our databases, processes, behaviours?

I know it sounds like I could be waffling for the majority of my talk but that is why I have set up this site. I want to start documenting my thought processes and hopefully add some structure to my debut talk!
