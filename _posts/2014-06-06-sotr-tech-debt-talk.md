It's done! After a few weeks of sleepless nights I've finally presented in public. I'd like to thank all the [advice](http://www.monkehworks.com/taking-to-the-stage-talking-at-your-first-conference) and support I've received over the last few days; it really helped. I'm sorry to say that I didn't break out into song! In the end I really enjoyed it; it certainly was a buzz! I was chuffed with the great questions at the end and the pre-presentation discussion too.

Non of the bits and pieces I presented are perfect, I'm not sure they'll ever be (I think that was the point of my talk). I'm always happy to chat about this stuff though and I'm always looking for new and better ways of doing things.

The slides from my presentation can be found on [slide share](http://t.co/pXmlbw7vrR).

Thanks also to the SOTR team for organising a great event. Roll on SOTR15!
